title: Build a new map in VIA

In this section, we'll learn how to create a new map yourself and drive autonomously on that map in the VIA simulator.

At the opening interface of the simulator, select **Design Map**.

The map design interface can be divided into 4 main parts as shown below:

- **(1)** Customize the background of the map (ground or grass)
- **(2)** Pre-designed roadway simulation blocks. We can drag and drop these blocks and combine them to form the complete map we want
- **(3)** Basic command buttons
    - ***Rotate*** (shortcut R): rotate the blocks
    - ***Erase*** (shortcut E): delete a certain block
    - ***Clear***: delete all blocks
    - ***Car***: choose the departure location of the car on the map (after the design is complete)
    - ***Save map, Load map***: save the current map or open a saved map
    - ***GO***: start driving

**(4)**: design space: we will drag and drop blocks here

I will try to create a map like the following image by dragging and dropping and joining the road blocks together. After pairing is complete, I press the **Car** button and put the car in the position where I want to start.

After designing, I choose **Save map**, enter the map name and select **OK** to save the map.
